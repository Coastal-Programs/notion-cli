### 2. Build Verification

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Result:** SUCCESS ✓
- No TypeScript compilation errors

## What Remains to Be Implemented

### Frontend-Developer Tasks (from TODO comments)

#### 1. Cache Lookup Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `src/utils/notion-resolver.ts` (lines 77-80, 133-154)

**Functions to implement:**
```typescript
async function searchCache(query: string, type: string): Promise<string | null> {
  // 1. Load cache using loadCache()
  // 2. Normalize query to lowercase
  // 3. Try exact title match first
  // 4. Try alias match second
  // 5. Return database ID or null
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Loads cache from `~/.notion-cli/databases.json`
- Finds database by exact title (case-insensitive)
- Finds database by any alias
- Returns clean Notion ID (32 hex chars without dashes)
- Returns null if not found

#### 2. API Fallback Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `src/utils/notion-resolver.ts` (lines 82-85, 160-178)

**Functions to implement:**
```typescript
async function searchNotionApi(query: string, type: string): Promise<string | null> {
  // 1. Call notion.search() with query
  // 2. Filter by object type (data_source or page)
  // 3. Return first match ID
  // 4. Handle errors gracefully (return null on failure)
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Uses existing `notion.search()` function
- Applies correct filter for database vs page
- Returns first match (best match)
- Handles rate limits and errors
- Returns null on failure (doesn't throw)

#### 3. Enable Resolution Stages (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `src/utils/notion-resolver.ts` (lines 77-85)

**Task:** Uncomment the cache lookup and API fallback code once implemented.

**Success Criteria:**
- Stage 3 (cache lookup) runs after Stage 2 (direct ID)
- Stage 4 (API fallback) runs after Stage 3
- Error messages updated to reflect name resolution is live

#### 4. Integrate into Commands (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/commands/db/query.ts` - Query databases by name
- `src/commands/db/update.ts` - Update databases by name
- `src/commands/page/create.ts` - Create pages in database by name

**Pattern to follow:**
```typescript
// Already done in src/commands/db/retrieve.ts (line 61)
const dataSourceId = await resolveNotionId(args.database_id, 'database')
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All commands accept names in addition to IDs/URLs
- Help text updated with name-based examples
- Error messages consistent across commands

## How to Verify Name Resolution Works

### Quick Smoke Test

After frontend-developer completes implementation:

```bash
# 1. Set token
export NOTION_TOKEN="secret_your_token"

# 2. Sync workspace
./bin/run sync

# Expected: Shows "✓ Found X databases"
# Creates: ~/.notion-cli/databases.json

# 3. List databases
./bin/run list

# Expected: Shows table with titles, IDs, aliases

# 4. Get database name from list
DB_NAME=$(./bin/run list --json | jq -r '.databases[0].title')

# 5. Retrieve by name
./bin/run db retrieve "$DB_NAME" --json

# Expected: Success with database details

# 6. Retrieve by alias
DB_ALIAS=$(./bin/run list --json | jq -r '.databases[0].aliases[0]')
./bin/run db retrieve "$DB_ALIAS" --json

# Expected: Success with same database

# 7. Verify backward compatibility (ID still works)
DB_ID=$(./bin/run list --json | jq -r '.databases[0].id')
./bin/run db retrieve "$DB_ID" --json

# Expected: Success with same database
```

### Full Integration Test

Follow the detailed scenarios in [NAME-RESOLUTION-TESTS.md](./NAME-RESOLUTION-TESTS.md):
- Test 1: Sync Workspace → List Databases
- Test 2: Retrieve by Exact Title
- Test 3: Retrieve by Alias
- Test 4: Retrieve by Partial Match
- Test 5: Retrieve by URL (Backward Compatibility)
- Test 6: Retrieve by Raw ID (Backward Compatibility)
- Test 7: Cache Miss → API Fallback
- Test 8: Helpful Error Messages

## Expected Test Results

### Unit Tests (After Implementation)

```bash
npm test

# Expected output:
Notion URL Parser
  isNotionUrl()
    ✓ should return true for valid Notion URLs
    ✓ should return false for non-Notion URLs
    ...
  extractNotionId()
    ✓ should extract ID from URL without dashes
    ✓ should extract ID from URL with dashes
    ...

Workspace Cache
  generateAliases()
    ✓ should generate basic aliases for simple names
    ✓ should handle plural/singular conversion
    ...
  buildCacheEntry()
    ✓ should build cache entry from full data source
    ...
  Cache File Operations
    ✓ should save and load cache correctly
    ...

Notion Resolver
  resolveNotionId() - URL input
    ✓ should resolve full Notion URL
    ...
  resolveNotionId() - Direct ID input
    ✓ should accept ID without dashes
    ...
  resolveNotionId() - Cache lookup
    ✓ should resolve by exact title
    ✓ should be case-insensitive
    ✓ should resolve by alias
    ✓ should resolve by acronym
    ...

42 passing (250ms)
```

### Integration Tests (Manual)

All 8 integration test scenarios should PASS:
- ✓ Sync workspace
- ✓ List databases
- ✓ Retrieve by exact title
- ✓ Retrieve by alias
- ✓ Retrieve by partial match
- ✓ Retrieve by URL
- ✓ Retrieve by raw ID
- ✓ Cache miss fallback

### Performance Benchmarks

Expected timings (on typical hardware):
- Sync (50 DBs): 3-5 seconds
- List cached DBs: < 100ms
- Name resolution: < 10ms (cache hit)
- API fallback: 200-500ms (cache miss)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Pre-existing Test Issue
**File:** `test/cache-retry.test.ts`
**Error:** ESM loading race condition
**Impact:** Prevents `npm test` from running
**Resolution:** Needs separate fix (unrelated to name resolution)

### 2. Name Resolution Not Yet Functional
**Status:** Code is present but commented out (TODO markers)
**Reason:** Waiting for frontend-developer to implement cache lookup
**Impact:** Name-based retrieval will throw "not found" error until implemented

### 3. No Partial Match Yet
**Status:** Not implemented
**Reason:** Marked as medium priority
**Impact:** Must use exact title or alias (no fuzzy matching)

### 4. No Disambiguation
**Status:** Not implemented
**Reason:** Marked as medium priority
**Impact:** If multiple databases match, will return first or error

## Next Actions

### For Frontend-Developer

1. **Review all documentation:**
   - Read BUILD-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md for architecture overview
   - Study UNIT-TEST-GUIDE.md for test patterns
   - Review NAME-RESOLUTION-TESTS.md for test scenarios

2. **Implement core functions:**
   - Start with `searchCache()` - no API calls, easier to test
   - Then implement `searchNotionApi()` - uses existing API client
   - Uncomment resolution stages in `resolveNotionId()`

3. **Write tests as you go:**
   - Copy test templates from UNIT-TEST-GUIDE.md
   - Run tests frequently: `npm test -- test/utils/notion-resolver.test.ts`
   - Verify each function works before moving to next

4. **Integrate into commands:**
   - Start with db/retrieve.ts (already done!)
   - Move to db/query.ts, db/update.ts
   - Finally page/create.ts

5. **Manual testing:**
   - Follow Quick Smoke Test above
   - Verify all 8 integration scenarios
   - Test error cases (database not found, cache missing)

6. **Update documentation:**
   - Add real examples to README
   - Update command help text
   - Document any discoveries or edge cases

### For Test Automation Agent (Me!)

I'm standing by to:
- **Run integration tests** once implementation is complete
- **Verify test coverage** and identify gaps
- **Create additional tests** for edge cases discovered
- **Document test results** in standardized format
- **File bug reports** for any issues found

Just ping me when the implementation is ready for testing!
